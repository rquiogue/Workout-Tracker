## Inspiration:
I’m creating this project to hone the skills that I have already learned such as basic React and api development, while learning new skills such as unit testing. I also want to learn more about the development lifecycle and am planning on using a modified Agile framework employing the use of stories to better segment my work.

## Skills and technologies used:
- React
